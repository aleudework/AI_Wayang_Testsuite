USER_REQUEST: Generate a Wayang plan that computes the total discounted revenue for shipments between the nations ‘GERMANY’ and ‘FRANCE’ during 1995 and 1996. Revenue is l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount). Join supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, and the nation tables, and keep only rows where the supplier is from one of the two nations and the customer is from the other. Use only shipments with l_shipdate between 1995-01-01 and 1996-12-31, extract the shipment year, and group results by supplier nation, customer nation, and year. Output in a textfile.
